## What is Markdown?

So the Markdown is a language to simplify your way to write your notes, Documents, your Readme file ... 

instead of using the fu\*\*ing boring Microsoft Word or the html wasting time opening and closing brackets! you can easily write the same thing just using some extensions that saves you a lot of time.
