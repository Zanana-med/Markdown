## What is Markdown?

So the Markdown is a language to simplify your way to write your notes, Documents, your Readme file ... 

instead of using the fu\*\*ing boring Microsoft Word or the html wasting time opening and closing brackets! you can easily write the same thing just using some extensions that saves you a lot of time. 

## What's on this article ?

Am **HERE** to give you all the shortcuts that you gonna need, not **wasting** your time about how the Markdown work !

Check the [official website](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) so that you can get information about Markdown and how it works and some stuff like that. 


# <u>Let's start !</u>
### 1 - Simple paragraph 

Add nothing to your text just start writing, but for the **new line** you need to create a space between the first paragraph and the second.

Also there is another way by adding two spaces after the first paragraph.

### 2 - Headings

Using the ' # ' character, and whenever you use less hashtags the header gonna be bigger.
The max of the header size is like the html header, if you pass over six hashtags the Markdown read it as a normal text.

### 3- **Bold**, *Italic* and ~~Strikethrough~~ Effect


>Note that on this part you can replace the \* Character with the  \_  character and everything work fine.

 1. ***Italic*** :
To make your part of text Italic you just need to put it between one asterisk character `*YOUR TEXT*` ---> *YOUR TEXT*

 2. **Bold** :
  And for the **Bold** effect just write it between two asterisk character `**YOUR TEXT**`  ---> **YOUR TEXT**

>Tip : Before you continue reading the next paragraph you now that 1 + 2 = 3 do you hh??

So what if i wanna use a text ***Bold & Italic*** at the same time ?
That's easy my friend! use that brain and find the solution by yourself am believing in you . 

3. **Strikethrough** :
For the Strickthrough effect just use two `~` character : `~~Jesse~~` ---> ~~Jesse~~

### 4 - Code blocks 

For implementing a code area to your notes and you have just one line, word or even character, you just need to put it inside one ``` ` ``` Character, so that ``` `Walter` ``` --->
`Walter`

If you have a long code, use three ` ``` ` characters, so that for example :

- instead of writing the boring way :  

\#include<unistd.h>
int main()
{
	write (1, "42", 2);
}  

- you can just use the Markdown code block:   
```c
#include <unistd.h>
int main()
{
	write(1, "42", 2);
}
```  

And a beautiful thing that you can have some decoration of the exact language you use.  
You just need to add the language  name beside the three ``` ` ``` :  
```
	```html
		<a href = "https://github.com/Zanana-med/">Welcome to my github</a>
	```
```  

the result Text gonna be :
```html
<a href = "https://github.com/Zanana-med/">Welcome to my github</a>
```
